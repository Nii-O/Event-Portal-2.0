# Event-Portal-2.0

This was my final project for IST 615 Cloud Management which is a class that teaches the basics of cloud computing, cloud infrastructure and cloud services like Microsoft Azure Web Services and Amazon Web Services. 
For this project my teammate and I decided to create a web-based events portal using Microsoft Azure Web Services.
